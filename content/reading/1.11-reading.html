<h2 id="recommended-readings">Recommended Readings:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 6.4 in Feenstra &amp; Taylor</li>
</ul>
<p>We will cover 6.1-6.2 next class.</p>
<p>I also strongly suggest you consume Paul Krugman’s <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2008/krugman/lecture/">2008 Economics Nobel Prize address</a> in some format. There is a video, his slides, and his written lecture posted there. I will be drawing from some of that today.</p>
