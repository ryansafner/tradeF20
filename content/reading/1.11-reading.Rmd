# Recommended Readings:

- Chapter 6.4 in Feenstra & Taylor

We will cover 6.1-6.2 next class.

I also strongly suggest you consume Paul Krugman’s [2008 Economics Nobel Prize address](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2008/krugman/lecture/) in some format. There is a video, his slides, and his written lecture posted there. I will be drawing from some of that today.

# Primary Sources Mentioned:

- [<i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> Krugman (1980), “Scale Economies, Product Differentiation, and Pattern of Trade”](/readings/Krugman-1980.pdf)
