<ul>
<li>What are the credible commitment problems present in each situation described in the papers?</li>

<li>How do these institutions appear, change, and/or disappear over time? (There are economic reasons!)</li>
<li>Are cartels always economically harmful?</li>
<li>How are these same problems present today?</li>
<li>Were monopolies, guilds, and other mercantilist restrictions all as bad as we economists often say they are?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discussion-board">Discussion Board</h2>
<p>Starting this week, we will occasionally have a weekly discussion board open on Blackboard.<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Not every week. I will let you know when we have one open at the beginning of each week.<br />
<br />
</span></span> You will be expected to contribute to the discussion board at least twice by Sunday night. Your weekly contribution will be graded out of 5 points. At the end of the semester, I will apply the average of your weekly participation grades to apply (20%) towards your final course grade.</p>
<p>I am interested in your thoughts, reactions, comments, and questions about any of the material (lectures and/or readings). You do not need to write more than a paragraph. Anything more than that, including continuing to reply to each others’ thoughts, questions, or comments, (which I strongly hope you do!) is solely based on your own interest and curiosity. I will jump in to answer questions the group is stuck on, give my two cents, and stir the pot as needed. I strontly hope we still keep a conversation going and can learn from each other, that was always my goal, not to lecture at you!</p>

<p>Recall, these are out of 5 points. Notice it is possible to get above 5 points for a truly remarkable week of contributions, but I give these sparingly.</p>
<p>At the end of the semester, I will drop your lowest participation score.</p>
