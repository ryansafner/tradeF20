<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Today, we continue looking at an intellectual history of trade, discussing new protectionist arguments that emerged since the decline of mercantilism.</p>
<p>It has probably been drilled in your head by economists that tariffs are bad (and I am happy to be only the latest professor doing it!). The overwhelming majority of economists agree that tariffs, in the practical, political, real world are not a net gain. The most sober-minded and non-ideological of them recognize that there are theoretical conditions where tariffs can be good for an economy - though identifying those conditions in the complexity of the real world is difficult.</p>
<p>I want to give the protectionists their due, and to that end, in this discussion (and the following one, on industrial policy), I want to push you all to confront two possibilities and grapple with them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There are conditions, however theoretical, where tariffs (or other trade restrictions, and not free trade) might be good.</li>
<li>Historically, the wealthy developed countries (e.g. Britain and the United States), while touting the ideology of free trade, were themselves quite protectionist for a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>The opponents of free trade have latched onto these facts historically (and today), and have historically made arguments that are a variation of: the U.S./U.K. became the wealthiest countries in the world BECAUSE of their tariffs, particularly in the 19th century. This has been a significant intellectual argument among certain elements of the economic nationalist right in this country, and this was well before President Trump arrived on the scene! Later, I will trace this argument from Alexander Hamilton in the 1790s through Friedrich List and Henry Clay in the 1830s to Pat Buchanan in the 1990s. I want us to grapple with this argument, and we will do so again in our following discussion on industrial policy (they are all related).</p>
