<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Today, we dive into a more formal Ricardian model that will ultimately be extended into the modern models of international trade over the coming weeks.</p>
<h2 id="readings">Readings</h2>
<p>Please see the suggested (but none are required) <a href="/reading/1.4-reading">today‚Äôs readings</a>. But note the following caution:</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Feenstra and Taylor dive right into a Ricardian model in Ch. 2 with some advanced features. This throws a lot of moving parts (marginal products of labor, indifference curves, world relative supply and world relative demand curves, export and import curves, etc.) at you very fast. In my experience, and having used different textbooks in the past, is that it is easier if I build more slowly to the full model. This class will be a ‚Äúsimplified Ricardian model‚Äù (there is a bit of fudging with marginal products vs.¬†‚Äúrequired labor‚Äù) that gets you to see some of the essentials before we layer on additional parts in next class on the ‚Äústandard‚Äù or ‚Äúneoclassical‚Äù trade model.</p>
<p>So if you are reading the textbook, it won‚Äôt exactly match up to class for 1-2 weeks üòï</p>

<p>Answers to last class‚Äô <a href="/practice/1.3-practice">practice problems</a> on simple comparative advantage are posted on that page. <strong>More practice questions (and answers) have also been added there!</strong> Today you will be working on <a href="/practice/1.4-practice">practice problems</a> on the Ricardian one-factor model. Answers will be posted later.</p>

<h2 id="translating-between-textbook-and-class">Translating Between Textbook and Class</h2>
<p>Feenstra and Taylor take an approach that focuses on the marginal product of labor for producing each good. Recall from microeconomics that the marginal product of labor is how much <em>additional</em> output will be produced from adding one more (marginal) worker (or ‚Äúunit of labor‚Äù). In the Ricardian model, the marginal product of labor is assumed to be a constant number, but different for each industry (and across countries). To solve a Ricardian model in this fashion, we need to be told the total supply of workers for each country <span class="math inline">\((L, L&#39;)\)</span>, as well as the marginal product of labor in each industry <span class="math inline">\((MPL_x, MPL_y; MPL&#39;_x, MPL&#39;_y)\)</span>, for each country.</p>
<p>In class, we used the total supply of labor in each country and the <em>labor required to make 1 unit</em> of each good in each country. <span class="math inline">\((l_x, l_y; l&#39;_x, l&#39;_y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is actually an easy clear relationship between these two approaches. The marginal product of labor for each good and the labor required to produce 1 unit of the good are <em>inversely related</em>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
MPL_x &amp;= \frac{1}{l_x}\\
MPL_y &amp;= \frac{1}{l_y}\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>This should make sense. If for example, the marginal product of labor in producing <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(MPL_x = 4\)</span>, this means that one worker can produce 4 units of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. In order to produce 1 unit of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, you only need <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span> workers.</p>
<p>From here, you can build the PPF equation (which, by the way, they <em>do not do</em> in the book!) as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L = \frac{x}{MPL_x}+\frac{y}{MPL_y}\]</span></p>
<p>This appears less intuitive, but it makes sense. The amount of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> a country makes divided by the amount of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> one worker can make gives the total labor allocation (labor demand) in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> industry. Do the same for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, and add them together, and you are using the total labor supply <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</p>
<p>From here, you can solve for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to graph:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = L * MPL_y - \frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x} x\]</span></p>
<p><img src="/class/1.4-class_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="576" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>This gives you a <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>-intercept of <span class="math inline">\(MPL_y * L\)</span>, which again should make sense: the most amount of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> a country could produce, it it <em>only</em> produced <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, is the total labor supply times the amount of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> each worker can produce.</p>
<p>The slope, however, is very different from what we got <span class="math inline">\(\left(-\frac{l_x}{l_y}\right)\)</span>, here it is <span class="math inline">\(\left(-\frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x}\right)\)</span>, notice the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> term is over the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> term. This is less intuitive than our approach, but it will fundamentally give you the same answer!</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{MPL_y}{MPL_x} = \cfrac{\left(\frac{1}{l_y}\right)}{\left(\frac{1}{l_x}\right)} = \frac{l_x}{l_y}\]</span></p>
<p>As an example, let‚Äôs take:</p>
<p>For Home:
- <span class="math inline">\(L=100\)</span>
- <span class="math inline">\(MPL_x = 1\)</span>
- <span class="math inline">\(MPL_y = 0.5\)</span></p>
<p>For Foreign:
- <span class="math inline">\(L&#39;=100\)</span>
- <span class="math inline">\(MPL_x = 1\)</span>
- <span class="math inline">\(MPL_y = 0.25\)</span></p>
<p>Home‚Äôs PPF:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
L&amp;=\frac{x}{MPL_x}+\frac{y}{MPL_y}\\
100&amp;=\frac{x}{1}+\frac{y}{0.5}\\
100&amp;=x+2y\\
50-0.5x &amp;= y\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Foreign‚Äôs PPF:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
L&#39;&amp;=\frac{x}{MPL_x&#39;}+\frac{y}{MPL_y&#39;}\\
100&amp;=\frac{x}{1}+\frac{y}{0.25}\\
100&amp;=x+4y\\
25-0.25x &amp;= y\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Which was the same as our PPFs in class!</p>
