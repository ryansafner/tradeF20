# Overview

Today, we dive into a more formal Ricardian model that will ultimately be extended into the modern models of international trade over the coming weeks.

# Readings

Please see the suggested (but none are required) [today's readings](/reading/1.4-reading). But note the following caution:

**Note:** Feenstra and Taylor dive right into a Ricardian model in Ch. 2 with some advanced features. This throws a lot of moving parts (marginal products of labor, indifference curves, world relative supply and world relative demand curves, export and import curves, etc.) at you very fast. In my experience, and having used different textbooks in the past, is that it is easier if I build more slowly to the full model. This class will be a ‚Äúsimplified Ricardian model‚Äù (there is a bit of fudging with marginal products vs. ‚Äúrequired labor‚Äù) that gets you to see some of the essentials before we layer on additional parts in next class on the ‚Äústandard‚Äù or ‚Äúneoclassical‚Äù trade model. 

So if you are reading the textbook, it won't exactly match up to class for 1-2 weeks üòï

# Practice Problems

Answers to last class‚Äô [practice problems](/practice/1.3-practice) on simple comparative advantage are posted on that page. Today you will be working on [practice problems](/practice/1.4-practice) on the Ricardian one-factor model. Answers will be posted later.
