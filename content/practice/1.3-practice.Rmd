*Gondor* and *Rohan* can each produce *oil (o)* and *linen (l)*. 

If Gondor devotes all of its resources to producing either good, it can produce 500 barrels of oil or 200 yards of linen. If Rohan devotes all of its resources to producing either good, it can produce 300 barrels of oil or 100 yards of linen. 

Currently, Gondor is producing 250 barrels of oil and 100 yards of linen, and Rohan is producing 150 barrels of oil and 50 units of linen.
