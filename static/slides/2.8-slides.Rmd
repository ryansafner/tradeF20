- If you agree with the following premises:
  1. Trade barriers are on in general harmful and inefficient on net for a society
  2. Trade barriers *do* benefit specific groups of people
  
- We need to answer two questions:
  1. Why do trade barriers that are often inefficient and welfare-reducing *persist*? 
  2. How is it possible to get groups or countries to *agree to reduce* trade barriers?

- Adam Smith cautions us that we should pay heed to the transitions of the labor market in moving to free trade abruptly

- Immediate abolition of all tariffs and protections, while it will help all consumers around the world and at home, will lead to temporary unemployment in the inefficient, domestically-protected industries

# The Strategy of Trade Agreements

.pull-left[
- Political infeasibility of unilateral free trade
  - note: opposite of politically stable policy: dispersed benefit, concentrated cost
  - Domestic import-competing industries are best-organized political group, stand to *lose* a large concentrated benefit with free trade
  
- Bilateral/multilateral trade agreements provide .hi[commitment strategies] for each nation
  - stack domestic exporters (who want access to foreign markets) as opposing concentrated political force to fight to open up trade
  - multiple groups in multiple countries with vested interest in keeping trade open
  - difficult for politicians in one country to impose tariffs to protect domestic importers (now have to fight exporters, not to mention other countries)
