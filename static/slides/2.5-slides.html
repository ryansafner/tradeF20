# Free Trade &amp; Classical Economics

- With the classical economists demolishing mercantilist policy, the ideology of the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century favored free trade

- However, free trade has rarely been good politics (we will see why soon)
  - Many tariffs &amp; restrictions remained

- Mercantilism and protectionism have always been crude self-interest arguments at others’ expense

- Needed more sophisticated protectionist arguments to rebut economic theory

- A Royal Marines officer, fought in Napoleonic Wars; became a member of Parliament and a colonial administrator
  - helped found South Australia as a colony
  - in favor of peaceful colonization as mutually beneficial, promote trade

- Classical economist, wrote with Ricardo, founding member of London’s Political Economy club
  - A fervent free-trader; argued for repeal of the Corn Laws
  - Came up with the term “territorial division of labor”
  - Arguably came up with principle of comparative advantage (3 years *before*, and *better than* Ricardo’s example)

- But later in 1840s, started having second thoughts?

1. The “terms of trade argument”
  - Reducing tariffs can harm a country’s terms of trade

2. In favor of the “principle of reciprocity” rather than unilateral free trade; what we now call .hi[strategic trade policy]
  - Goal: “to adopt, with all foreign powers, the principle of reciprocity”
  - Better to get countries to agree to reduce tariffs in unison
  - A single country reducing tariffs can hurt its terms of trade
  - thought that in the long run, this would lead to freer trade around the world
  - thought (correctly), that the British Empire had the influence to successfully engage in strategic trade policy

- Example, suppose Britain and Cuba trade, and Cuba imposes tariffs against imports from Britain

&gt; “[T]he ultimate incidence of the import duty imposed on British goods would be upon British producers. The wealth of Engaland would be decreased by the amount of the duty—the ewalth of Cuba would be increased by its amount.”

- Under a gold standard, gold would flow out of Britain into Cuba

- Torrens is more worried about the consequences of *this*, as he thinks it could lead to severe deflation, “national bankruptcy and revolution...the probable result.” 

&gt; “A rise in the value of money [deflation] is one of the greatest evils which can occur”

It incurs a further, and in many instances greater, injury—in the general diminution of the efficiency of its own industry, occasioned by the misdirection of capital and the diminished division of labour.”

# John Stuart Mill’s Qualified Defense of Torrens

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Mill reasons that it is possible, but it depends on the elasticity of foreign supply for our imports
  - without using those words, as “price elasticity” has not been “discovered” yet

- Perfectly elastic foreign demand `\(\implies\)` no terms of trade effect

- Non-perfectly elastic foreign demand `\(\implies\)` a terms of trade effect

- Recall our discussion of a large vs. a small country putting a tariff on imports!

# The Torrens-Mill Theory

.pull-left[

- Developed two theories:

1. Under certain circumstances, lowering a (pre-existing) tariff can deteriorate a country’s terms of trade
2. A country lowering a tariff may suffer a net loss

- The first is clear, the second is speculative
  - would lowering a tariff lower TOT more than the gains from greater trade??
