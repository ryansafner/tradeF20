- **What We've Learned**: 
  - Predict &amp; understand why and what countries trade (Trade Models)
  - Consequences of trade barriers (tariffs, quotas, subsidies, etc)
  - Intellectual history of free trade &amp; protectionist arguments
  
- **What's Left**: for good or bad, **why** do countries have the trade policies they have today? 
  - A theory of how politics interacts with economics: \alert{political economy}

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- If you agree with the following premises:
  1. Trade barriers are on in general harmful and inefficient on net for a society
  2. Trade barriers *do* benefit specific groups of people
  
- We need to answer two questions:
  1. Why do trade barriers that are often inefficient and welfare-reducing *persist*? 
  2. How is it possible to get groups or countries to *agree to reduce* trade barriers?

- Adam Smith cautions us that we should pay heed to the transitions of the labor market in moving to free trade abruptly

- Immediate abolition of all tariffs and protections, while it will help all consumers around the world and at home, will lead to temporary unemployment in the inefficient, domestically-protected industries

# The Strategy of Trade Agreements

.pull-left[
- Unilateral free trade is the theoretically ideal strategy
    - we immediately drop all tariffs
    - economists continuously recommend this, dispersed benefits outweigh concentrated costs
  
- But this is not good politics!

# The Strategy of Trade Agreements

.pull-left[
- Political infeasibility of unilateral free trade
  - note: opposite of politically stable policy: dispersed benefit, concentrated cost
  - Domestic import-competing industries are best-organized political group, stand to *lose* a large concentrated benefit with free trade
  
- Bilateral/multilateral trade agreements provide .hi[commitment strategies] for each nation
  - stack domestic exporters (who want access to foreign markets) as opposing concentrated political force to fight to open up trade
  - multiple groups in multiple countries with vested interest in keeping trade open
  - difficult for politicians in one country to impose tariffs to protect domestic importers (now have to fight exporters, not to mention other countries)

.pull-left[

- .hi[Unilateral free trade]: (very rare), a single country removes all trade restrictions against other countries

- .hi[Bilateral Trade Agreements]: two countries agree to eliminate trade barriers on goods traded just between their two countries
  - The most popular strategy, most countries have bilateral agreements with others

- .hi[Customs Union/Common Market]: several countries (usually in a region) agree to eliminate trade barriers 
  - U.S. Constitution; European Union; North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)

2. .hi-turquoise[Trade diversion]: .pink[Japan] is actually a more efficient producer than .purple[Mexico] (if no tariffs), but U.S. only trades with .purple[Mexico] because .hi[Japan] is outside free trade zone
  - U.S. trade diverted from .pink[Japan] to .purple[Mexico]
