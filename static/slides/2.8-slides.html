  - Consequences of trade barriers (tariffs, quotas, subsidies, etc)

- **What's Left**: for good or bad, **why** do countries have the trade policies they have today?

- If you agree with the following premises:
  1. Trade barriers are on in general harmful and inefficient on net for a society
  2. Trade barriers *do* benefit specific groups of people
  
- We need to answer two questions:
  1. Why do trade barriers that are often inefficient and welfare-reducing *persist*? 
  2. How is it possible to get groups or countries to *agree to reduce* trade barriers?

.quitesmall[

&gt; “[I]t may sometimes be a matter of deliberation [how to remove tariffs] when some foreign nation restrains by high duties or prohibitions the importation of some of our manufactures into their country. Revenge in this case naturally dictates retaliation, and that we should impose the like duties and prohibitions upon the importation of some or all of their manufactures into our country...nations accordingly seldom fail to retaliate in this manner.”

&gt; “There may be a good policy in retaliations of this kind...The recovery of a great foreign market will generatlly more than compensate the transitory inconveniency of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods. To judge whether such retaliations are likely to produce such an effect...[belongs] to the skill of that insidious and crafty animal, vulgarly called the statesman or politician, whose councils are directed by the momentary fluctuations of affairs.”

&gt; “[Reciprocity] would hold out to [foreign countries] a powerful inducement to act upon the principles of reciprocal freedom” - Torrens

&gt; “[C]onsiderations of reciprocity...are of material importance when the repeal of duties...is discussed. A country cannot be expected to renounce the power of taxing foreigners, unless foreigners will in return practise towards itself the same forbearance. The only mode in which a country can save itself from being a loser by the duties imposed by other countries on its commodities, is to impose corresponding duties on theirs.” - Mill

# Finding Commitments: Bilateral Agreements

.pull-left[
.quitesmall[
- .hi[Bilateral/multilateral trade agreements] provide .hi-purple[commitment strategies] for each nation to reduce tariffs

- Traditionally, it’s concentrated benefits to domestic importers who lobby politicians to put up tariffs

- With a trade agreement, domestic *exporters* (who *want* free access to foreign markets) act as a concentrated political force fighting to lower tariffs

- Creates *multiple* groups in *multiple* countries with vested interest in keeping trade open (tariffs down)

- More concentrated &amp; strongly interested groups fighting *against* tariffs than *for* tariffs!
  - Less incentive for domestic politician to cater to protectionist interests
