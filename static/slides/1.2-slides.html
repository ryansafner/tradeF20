&gt; "It is but a very small part of a man's wants which the produce of his own labour can supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by exchanging that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labour as he has occasion for. Every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes in some measure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commercial society," (Book I, Chapter 4).

&gt; "To take an example...from a very trifling manufacture...the trade of the **pin-maker**. [I]n the way in which this business is now carried on, not only the whole work is a peculiar trade, but it is divided into a number of branches, of which the greater part are likewise peculiar trades. One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head...and **the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations**...**Ten men only were employed [and they] could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day...But if they had all wrought separately and independently [they] certainly could not each of them have made twenty, perhaps not one pin in a day...**" (Book I, Chapter 1).

&gt; "The important thing, of course, is that **with the division of labour a group of complex processes is transformed into a succession of simpler processes, some of which, at least, lend themselves to the use of machinery**. In the use of machinery and the adoption of indirect processes there is a further division of labour, the economies of which are again **limited by the extent of the market**. **It would be wasteful to make a hammer to drive a single nail; it would be better to use whatever awkward implement lies conveniently at hand**," (p.530).

&gt; "The market Smith was talking about was the number of potential (and, in an important sense, actual!) customers for the product in question. As the ability of transport and communications to handle trade increases, the size of factories increases. Let me say that again, because it is so obvious it's confusing. .hi[As the number of potential customers you can reach expands, and the costs of shipping and handling fall, factories become fewer and larger.] There is far more capital investment in these factories, but fewer workers. And output increases ten-fold, a hundred-fold, a billion-fold."

&gt; "Today, most pin manufacture has moved to Asia. Your first impulse might be to nod and think, ``Sure, cheap labor.'' But that is not an important part of the story. Pin manufacturing is highly capital intensive. Smith's insight on the division of labor, and Howe's idea of making the process continuous and making labor more productive, have combined to expand the market for Chinese pins to the whole world. The number of workers engaged in pin manufacture in China has \emph{fallen}, not risen, as pin output has expanded. And wages have increased more than ten-fold, as productivity has exploded"
